Problem Misakamikoto
My friends like anime way too much . . . they decided that to give me an encoded message, but I can't solve it because I'm not a weeb!

hint:railguns are cool

Many people think about anime I guess same goes with me I tried with transposition cipher with many keys but none work than I look at hint nicely what it really say than I looked types of cipher where I get "rail" cipher and just in a click I get online decoder and decode the code.

Solution: "rail" cipher
